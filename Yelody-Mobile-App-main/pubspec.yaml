# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
    - assets/images/onbaording/
    - assets/icons/
    - assets/icons/bottom/
    - assets/audios/
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware
  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Urbanist
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Urbanist-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Urbanist-Medium.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Urbanist-MediumItalic.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Urbanist-SemiBold.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Urbanist-SemiBoldItalic.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Urbanist-Bold.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Urbanist-ExtraBold.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Urbanist-ExtraLight.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Urbanist-Italic.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Urbanist-Light.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Urbanist-Black.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
